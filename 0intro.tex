\chapter{Introduction}

The project chosen for this report is the creation of a web application for the Monaleen Tennis Club. This is a club within the Castletroy area, near to the University. The club uses an existing paper based system, and the goal of this report is to establish the process necessary to manage a project to provide a software solution to the organisation. 

The project group consisted of Chris O'Brien, Project Manager, with Shane Whelan and Brian O'Donoghue. We examined the process as detailed by the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).

We focused on the following areas:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Project Integration
\item Project Scope Management
\item Project Time Management
\item Project Cost Management
\item Project Quality Management
\item Project Risk Management
\item Project Human Resource Management
\end{enumerate}

Microsoft Project, Agena Risk and Cocomo were used to manage project planning, risk, and cost.
